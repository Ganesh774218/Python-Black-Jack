# Python-Black-Jack
A python project on Blackjack Game build using on jupyter notebook/lab.

Project Objective - 
The primary goal of this project is to simulate the classic Blackjack card game using Python, allowing users to play against a computer dealer. The game incorporates core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and logic-based decision-making.

Overview - 
This Python-based Blackjack game, built in Jupyter Notebook, allows players to engage in a casino-style card game against the dealer. The project implements fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), loops, conditionals, and user interaction.

Tools used - 
Language: Python
IDE/Editor - Jupyter Notebook
Key Libraries - random module (to shuffle the deck and deal cards)
              Built-in I/O and control structures

Features & Functionality -
Procedure -
ðŸ”¹ Uses standard Blackjack rulesâ€”player vs. dealer with the goal of reaching 21 points.
ðŸ”¹ Supports hit, stand, and automatic dealer rules.
ðŸ”¹ Implements card deck shuffling and dealing.
ðŸ”¹ Tracks player betting system (optional) to simulate real casino play.
ðŸ”¹ The game is structured using OOP principles - 
    Card Class â†’ Represents individual playing cards with suit and rank.
    Deck Class â†’ Manages shuffling and dealing of cards.
    Player Class â†’ Handles player actions (hit, stand, check for bust).
    Dealer Class â†’ Implements AI-controlled dealer logic.
    Game Class â†’ Controls the overall game flow and logic.
    
Key Modules/Functions - 
ðŸ”¹ create_deck() â€“ Initializes and returns a full shuffled deck.
ðŸ”¹ deal_card(deck) â€“ Deals a single card from the deck.
ðŸ”¹ calculate_score(hand) â€“ Calculates score of a hand, adjusting for Aces.
ðŸ”¹ display_hand(hand) â€“ Shows the current cards held.
ðŸ”¹ blackjack_game() â€“ The main function that controls game flow.

Skills Demonstration - 
ðŸ”¹ Python fundamentals (functions, lists, loops)
ðŸ”¹ OOP (if implemented using classes like Card, Deck, Player)
ðŸ”¹ Control flow and decision logic
ðŸ”¹ Simulated real-world application of game theory
ðŸ”¹ Basic UI using print statements and input
